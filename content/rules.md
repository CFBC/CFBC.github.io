# Coleman Fitbit Competition

Welcome to the first (annual?) Coleman Fitbit Competition.


## Rules

The spirit of the competition is to acquire as many steps as possible on your own. Below are some basic rules, but these obviously do not cover every case. Any type of "taking advantage" of the fitbit is against the spirit of the competition and can result in disqualification.

1. All steps must be taken by the individual competing. No attaching your fitbit to (but not limited to): Pets, Friends, Siblings, etc...
2. No editing your steps to include steps taken while not wearing your fitbit. You must be wearing your fitbit for the steps to count.

## Points

Points will be awarded on a weekly, monthly, and yearly basis. In order to encourage people to rest for at least one day a week, step counts on Sunday will never factor into totals.

#### Weekly Points

At the end of every week:

* The three individuals who have the most number of steps are awarded 3, 2, and 1 points respectively
* Anyone who takes more than 50,000 steps in the week is awarded 1 point

#### Monthly Points

At the end of every month:

* The three individuals who have the most number of steps are awarded 5, 3, and 1 points respectively
* The three individuals who have the most number of days with more than 10,000 steps are awarded 10, 5, and 3 points respectively

#### Yearly Points

At the end of the year:

* The individual who took the most steps in a single day is awarded 15 points
* The individual with most total steps for the year is awarded 15 points
* The individual with the most days over 10,000 steps is awarded 15 points
